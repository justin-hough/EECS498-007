If you're interested in deep learning and computer vision and you have some prerequisite knowledge, I highly recommend this course.

Thanks to Professor Justin Johnson and the team of instructors/aides. View the [**Course Website**](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~justincj/teaching/eecs498/WI2022/) and [**Lecture YouTube Playlist**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-TkQAfAZFbzxjBHtzdVCWE0Zbhomg7r) to get started.

## Course Overview

The course provides a "deep dive into details of neural-network based deep learning methods for computer vision". Over the 25 lectures and 6 assignments, you cover the theory of learning algorithms and many neural network architectures, plus there are plenty of practical engineering tricks for implementing, training, and debugging your own networks.

### Topics Covered

- Computer vision overview and historical context
- K-nearest neighbours
- Hyperparameters and cross-validation
- Linear classifiers
- Optimisation algorithms (SGD, AdaGrad, Adam)
- Fully-connected networks
- Backpropagation (including by hand...)
- Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
- Image classification architectures
- Training techniques (data preprocessing & augmentation, regularisation, hyperparameter optimisation, model ensembling)
- Object detection architectures
- Image segmentation architectures
- Recurrent neural networks (RNNs)
- Transformers
- Generative models (VAEs and GANs)
- Network visualization
- Style transfer
- Self-supervised learning
- 3D vision (depth estimation, 3D shape predictions)
- Video classification architectures
- The future of computer vision (as of 2022...)
